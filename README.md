# String-Calculator

A rusty Dania had been intensely job-hunting whilst her fingers and coding skills were dusting on the shelves. It was a week which she had not coded and she felt very sad about it. Then, she came across this PostCourse that recommended her to do Katas to get her back on her feet.

She attempted it once, twice even to get the swing of things, which led her doing the String Calculator Kata.

The stringCalculator Kata has nine steps to follow
[here](http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/). However, given that Dania gave herself a time limit of two days, she only managed to complete the following steps.

- The calculate method could take no arguments
- The calculate method could take one argument
- The calculate method could take two arguments
- The calculate method eliminates spaces.
- The calculate method will refuse to take negative numbers

Her journey of figuring out deliminators is yet to be solved. However, this is what she has so far.

## How To Use

1. Clone the repo
```
https://github.com/thatdania/StringCalculator-.git
```

2. change to the project directory
```
cd StringCalculator
```

3. open SpecRunner.html in terminal
```
open SpecRunner.html
```

4. See all the tests pass but open the console in browser.

5. Write this in the console
```
var string = new StringCalculator()
```

6. Look at the code to test out the methods but if you want it here, place individual strings into the method as such
```
string.calculate('1','2')
```
